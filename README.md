# R-and-Google-Sheets-S.-benedicti-reproduction
As a data analyst, your task for this assignment is to use R and Excel to conduct an analysis of the reproduction of Streblospio benedicti with the intention of producing a scientific poster on the subject.

The examination of the data consists of a statistical analysis as well as a depiction of the morphological and developmental variations that exist between the two types of larvae. The findings of this study, which will be presented in the form of a scientific poster, seek to gain an understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the development and reproduction of S. benedicti.

All data can be found in Worm Brood Information.xls
R coding scripts are available for each piece of data.
