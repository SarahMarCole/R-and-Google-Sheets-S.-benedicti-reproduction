# R-and-Google-Sheets-S.-benedicti-reproduction
## üî¨ Overview
As a data analyst, I used R and Excel to conduct an analysis of the reproduction of Streblospio benedicti with the intention of producing a scientific poster on the subject.


The examination of the data consists of a statistical analysis as well as a depiction of the morphological and developmental variations that exist between the two types of larvae. The findings of this study, which will be presented in the form of a scientific poster, seek to gain an understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the development and reproduction of S. benedicti.


Final project including hypotheses, questions, and concludes can be found in [Final Poster Presentation.pdf](https://github.com/SarahMarCole/R-and-Google-Sheets-S.-benedicti-reproduction/blob/main/Final%20Poster%20Presentation.pdf)
